    <p class="about-me-p">My name is Madeleine Conanan. I was born in Alabama in 1992, but have called the Bay Area my home 
        for many years. I graduated with my Bachelor's of Science in Nursing in 2016 and have worked as a Registered Nurse
        in various Intensive Care Units since then. This year, I have taken my love of critical thinking and problem solving away
        from the bedside and into the digital world. My attention to detail has married my love
        of design, and I am now able to use these carefully honed skills to bring web pages to life.
