# my-portfolio-page

"My Portfolio Page" was created to display current and future projects, and author contact information.
A large header appears top right with name of author. On hover, the author's pronouns display below. A large header image has been provided to enhance the overall theme of the page.

Links to Github, LinkedIn, and Email are located in bottom right hand of header. On hover, the links change color to enhance visibility.

The page's main content features two sections on each side of the page. 

The left side features "Projects." The first thumbnail is of a Landing Page the author created. On hover, a border displays around the thumbnail. Once clicked, the link takes user to the repository for the created page. Underneath is the title of the thumbnail, and the date it was created.
The next thumbnail says "coming soon" to indicate that there will be more projects placed there in  the furture.

The right side features the "About Me." A profile photo has been added, along with a paragraph of info about the author. 

There is a footer at the bottom of the page that states the year the webpage was created.
The footer also includes a link back to the top of the page. 

Media queries have been applied so that the webpage can be re-sized, and can be viewed from multiple devices.
